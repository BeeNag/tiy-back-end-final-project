Outline

An application where users can look-up general advive for games on a variety of devices (i.e. PS4, XBOX ONE and PC). On entry to the site they will have the opportunity to select the platform they would like to begin searching for advice on. They will then be taken to a seperate page where they will select the game they want and be shown the tips for that selected game. On this page the user will also have the opportunity to add a piece of advice for a game that is already present, or add an entirely new game (with tips) to the database. If there is time, I am also playing with the idea of adding a message board function which users will be able to access once they have selected a platform and game.
